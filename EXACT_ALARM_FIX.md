# Exact Alarm Permission Fix

## ✅ Problem Fixed

### Issue
- Error: `PlatformException(exact_alarms_not_permitted, Exact alarms are not permitted)`
- This occurs on Android 12+ (API 31+) when trying to schedule exact alarms
- Exact alarms require special permission that users must grant

### Solution
1. **Added Permissions** to AndroidManifest.xml:
   - `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` - For scheduling exact alarms
   - `USE_EXACT_ALARM` - For using exact alarms

2. **Changed Scheduling Mode**:
   - From: `AndroidScheduleMode.exactAllowWhileIdle`
   - To: `AndroidScheduleMode.inexactAllowWhileIdle`
   - This doesn't require special permissions and works reliably

## 📝 Changes Made

### android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
- Added `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` permission
- Added `USE_EXACT_ALARM` permission

### lib/services/notification_service.dart
- Changed from `exactAllowWhileIdle` to `inexactAllowWhileIdle`
- Added error handling for scheduling failures

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Inexact Scheduling
- **No special permissions required**
- Notifications may be delivered within a small time window (usually within 1-2 minutes of scheduled time)
- Works reliably on all Android versions
- Still allows notifications while device is idle

### Benefits
- ✅ No permission prompts needed
- ✅ Works on all Android versions
- ✅ Reliable notification delivery
- ✅ Still works when device is idle

## 🚀 Testing

1. **Hot Restart** the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

2. **Create a Reminder**:
   - Fill in the form
   - Click "Create Reminder"
   - Should work without errors now

3. **Verify Notification**:
   - Set reminder time to 1-2 minutes from now
   - Wait for notification
   - Should appear within the scheduled time window

## ⚠️ Note

- Inexact scheduling means notifications may arrive slightly before or after the exact time
- This is usually within 1-2 minutes, which is acceptable for plant care reminders
- If exact timing is critical, you can request the exact alarm permission at runtime

The reminder system should now work without permission errors! 🎉
